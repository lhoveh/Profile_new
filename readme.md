This is my first profile page. It has a brief description of my professional profile. The design is based on a template from Wix. There is very little information about my CV, experience,
and description since the idea was to practice CSS and Vanilla JS.

It also contains a link to projects, which are exercises rather than previous jobs or completed works.
